# MCP Setup and AI Agent Configuration Report

##  What I Did

* **MCP Server Configuration**: I configured my IDE to connect to the **Tenx MCP Analysis server**. This involved creating the necessary configuration files (`mcp.json`) and setting the appropriate headers (`X-Device` and `X-Coding-Tool`) to ensure my interactions are logged for feedback.


* **Agent Rules Implementation**: Created a `.vscode` folder in my working directory and established an `mcp.json` configuration file within it.

* **Research & Integration**: I researched best practices for AI agent instructions, specifically focusing on **Boris Cherny’s** workflow. I integrated "Chain of Thought" reasoning, concise communication styles, and mandatory verification steps into the agent's core instructions.
